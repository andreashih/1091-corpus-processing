# Introduction

Nowadays, *Web-as-Corpus* (WaC) [@kilgarriff2003] has become the main approach in corpus-based linguistics studies. Extracting information from the web is efficient for building a large corpus. However, word segmentation errors can cause several problems because (a) the emergence of new words is too rapid to catch up with and (b) the lack of Chinese word boundaries makes the pre-processing even more challenging. This study is a follow-up study of Hsieh (2014) [@hsieh2014] that aims to inspect whether recent WaC encounters difficulties of word segmentation errors. 

# Methods

This study utilizes the *zipfR* package [@evert2007] to analyze the lexical richness and the lexical coverage of two web corpora, which are the PTT corpus and the Dcard corpus. After being fitted to the LNRE model [@baayen2002], the lexical richness will be observed by their vocabulary growth curves (VGC) and the lexical coverage will be estimated by their Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) rates. The results will be compared with the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus (ASBC), whose word boundary delimitation is corrected manually, and the Brown corpus, in which words are already separated by spaces.

# Results

The results of the vocabulary growth curves (VGC) and Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) rates are presented below:

```{r, fig.cap='The observed and expected VGC of four different corpora', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://andreashih.github.io/img/rmd_posts/zipfr/all_vgc_exp.png')
```

In Figure 1, the thinner red curves refer to the estimated V1, which is the expected type frequency when the type occurs only once. The V1 curves of ASBC and Brown corpus are smoother than those of PTT and Dcard corpus.

In Table 1, the expected OOV rate in ASBC and Brown are less than those in PTT and Dcard corpus. Besides, they are more stable while the corpora sizes expand.

```{r}
d <- data.frame(Corpus = c('ASBC', 'Brown', 'PTT', 'Dcard'),
                N1_OOV = c(0.7751460, 0.7299293, 0.8847203, 0.8608032),
                N10_OOV = c(0.7844322, 0.7347804, 0.9098196, 0.8905452),
                N100_OOV = c(0.7844322, 0.7347804, 0.9098338, 0.8905602))
knitr::kable(d, caption = 'Expected OOV rate of the four corpora at the corpus sizes of 1M, 10M, and 100M')
```

From the comparison of the four corpora, it can be concluded that WaC such as PTT and Dcard corpus are more likely to encounter segmentation problems, which lead to a high proportion of OOVs. Therefore, segmentation errors should be carefully treated when building Chinese WaC.
